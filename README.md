- 👋 Hi, I’m @etiennepalos , a PhD student at UC San Diego. Member of the Paesani Research Group.
- 👀 I’m interested in THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY and CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on understanding and developing theoretical models for a unified molecular-level understanding of multiscale processes in chemistry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve and combine: electronic structure theory, many-body molecular dynamics, hybrid quantum/clasical modeling, and machine learning.
